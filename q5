Scenario:
A junior developer on your team has written the following Django view to handle a POST request. However, they did not clean or validate the incoming data. The data directly interacts with the database, which could lead to potential vulnerabilities or issues.

Junior Developer's Code:

from django.http import JsonResponse
from .models import Task

def create_task(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        data = request.POST
        task = Task.objects.create(
            title=data["title"],
            description=data.get("description", ""),
            is_completed=data.get("is_completed", False),
        )
        return JsonResponse({"id": task.id, "message": "Task created successfully!"})
