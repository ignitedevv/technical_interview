Task 3: React Native Feature Implementation

Objective: Test React Native skills, especially in building user interfaces and handling platform differences.

Prompt: Build a React Native component for a simple "Task Timer":

Display a list of tasks.
Each task has a "Start Timer" button.
Show a timer that counts down from 25 minutes when started.
Questions:

How would you handle state for multiple timers?
How would you ensure the timer works reliably across app backgrounding?
