Implement a React Native app with two screens using react-navigation. The app should have:

A "Home" screen with a button to navigate to a "Details" screen.
A "Details" screen that displays a counter, with buttons to increment and decrement the counter.
The counter value should persist when navigating back to the Home screen.
